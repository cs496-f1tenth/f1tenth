# 3D Models
All the models are custom created and modified by our team. They've gone through a few different iterations over time. The current version of each model is what we consider to be our best rendition of said part. 

## Printing
Also included in this directory is the stl folder, here you will find ready to splice and 3D print files. 

## Our build
All of our parts were prototyped using PLA due to its' affordability with less infill and wider layer gaps for quicker print times.

Once modifications and changes are made and we are ready for a durable final product, we print the piece using PETG, with more infill, and more layers in order to ensure maximum durability for a race-ready part.
